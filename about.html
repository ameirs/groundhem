                  <div class="rich-text"><p>Groundhem initiative is an independent, ad-hoc research unit formed in 2016 to investigate and produce evidence for claims of state terror, mass displacement, urbicide and forced development in Diyarbakir, Southeast Turkey. We are an international, multidisciplinary practice group that seeks not only to identify, verify, and publicize potential war crimes in the specified context; but, moreover, to invent new ways of witnessing and responding to the dynamics of contemporary warfare. Asymmetrical warfare operates at scales and through tactics that often conceal its most devastating effects. Acute, highly-localized operations are buried in a mediascape that also fails to account for the longer durations of what we call contemporary warfare’s “hostile aftermaths.” In response, we have developed a set of methods-- in part through our work with Forensic Architecture and the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University-- that allows us to produce alternative images of asymmetrical warfare, sensitive to scales and dimensions of harm that are often forcibly disappeared. To this end, we actively partner with local civil society organizations and affected residents to build multi-scalar, multi-dimensional evidence attesting to the ground truth experienced by stakeholders in-situ.</p>
                  <p> In 2015, a local Kurdish autonomist youth cell declared self-governance in their neighborhoods of Sur, the old city district of Diyarbakir. Turkish military forces subsequently unleashed a high-intensity campaign to reclaim centralized control of the walled city. The dense urban fabric has long facilitated communal organization and, in the context of armed conflict, its narrow streets provided a bulwark against heavy artillery incursions into the life-space of the city. The city was “turned off” by mandatory 24 hour curfews that trapped civilians in the battlespace without water, food or electricity. This situation, enhanced by psychological operations, effectively catalyzed mass migration of Old City-dwellers from their besieged neighborhoods. This forced-displacement ultimately amounted to eviction: nearly every parcel of privately-owned land was expropriated by the state in the middle of the conflict. With the city expropriated and emptied, large swaths of UNESCO-listed urban terrain were tactically demolished to clear paths for the passage of armored vehicles and tanks into the city’s core. After the conflict, half of the city remained under curfew-- barricaded and inaccessible to displaced civilians and third-party watch dogs. It was in this opaque zone, which today continues to blend the spacetime of war into the civil domain, that the large-scale transformation project was initiated. The spatial and legal operations of high-intensity urban warfare were coupled with those of zoning and urban planning to achieve development by other means. Warfare did the work, on the ground, of executing and implementing urban design. Our initial investigations have focused on this specific continuity between armed conflict and non-consensual development. Since the cessation of hostilities, multiple hectares of urban terrain have been razed to the ground behind the barricades of civic warfare, and glistening new units meant to simulate the historical texture of the city have popped up, built by private contractors at exponential margins, in their (dis)place.</p>
                  <p> Our framework and methods were developed in direct relation to these situational dynamics. These conditions thus inform our three key objectives-- those features of contemporary conflict that we find it most critical to image:
                  The built and natural environments in which a community makes its life are integral to its self-consitution. Warfare that operates destructively within these life-spaces-- through urbicide, ecocide, etc-- functions to undo this self-constitution. Where warfare serves the purposes of State-led spatial transformation, State-led post-conflict reconstruction projects will continue the aims of armed conflict.Similarly to warfare, urban planning can be weaponized by the state to quell resistance to oppressive governing practices and reconfigure urban characteristics that facilitate such resistance.While we developed these lenses in Diyarbakir, we believe that they can be useful in bearing witness to asymmetrical conflicts throughout the world. In our sub-project pages appear curated demos of the tools that we have honed and synthesized to visualize these overlapped aspects of contemporary warfare and forced development.</p>
