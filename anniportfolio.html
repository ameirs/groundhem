                  <div class="rich-text"><p><br>During a workshop in Istanbul lead by
the Turkish NGO »Beyond Istanbul«, Anna Greunig and fellow researchers Lila Steinkampf and Insa Deist, engaged in an exchange
with the lawyers of the »Marmara Park« trial, thus getting an
insight into the court publication of the advocacy which
was prepared particularly for this case. As a result of this
process, they realized an installation, reconstructing the
crime scene in form of architectural renderings and a 3D
print model.</p>

<p>On the one hand the translation of evidence
into the formal language of an architecture project pitch
raises the question, if certain visual strategies can be
beneficial to protracted court cases, by using a certain
set of visual models. On the other hand it is a commentary
on the discrepancy between sold vision and reality
inherent in architectural renderings. These images,
which usually sell a story of the city as a place of utopian
modernity and inconsequential consumption, are now
showing the downsides of an urban commercialization,
where economic profit is being prioritized over the well
being of citizens and workers.</p>

<p>»Labour Murder« is, according to the support
group of » Workers’ Families Seeking Justice« (WFSJ),
the appropriate term for fatal working accidents which
could have been prevented by an adequate inspection of
workplaces and the compliance of safety measures. On
March 11th, 2012, eleven workers died on the construction
site of the Marmara Park Shopping Centre in Istanbul
as a result of a fire blaze in their accommodation
units. This major project was carried out by the Turkish
subsidiary of a German company called ECE Group. The
fire was triggered by a short-circuit and highly inflammable
nylon tents, which were too close together and
had only one exit. By handing over the responsibility to
sub-subcontractors, the transnational companies were
acquitted. The families of the victims and their lawyers
filed a complaint with the Supreme Court, which was
rejected.</p>

                  <p><br>In exchange with the NGO »Hafıza Merkezi«, two
web-based projects were developed, which engage with
the Kurdish culture of remembrance in Turkey.
The first project is a virtual space that deals with the
demolition of the Roboski memorial. To defy physical
destruction, a 3D Reconstruction of the destroyed monument,
was published on virtual-memory.org. In cases of
deliberate destruction of cultural sites, the virtual space
can be used for reconstruction, thus becoming a space
of resistance and counter-narrative. The Roboski monument
was erected in Diyarbakır to commemorate 34 civilians
of Kurdish origin who were victims of an air strike
by the Turkish military in December 2011.
During the second project we published, placeholders
for »virtual monuments« on Google Maps, dedicated to
the civilians who died during the conflict in Diyarbakır in
the 1990s. The aim of this experiment was to illustrate
the possibility of using Google maps as a tool to place
monuments in the virtual space individually.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, clashes between Turkish security
forces and the PKK escalated into extreme state violence
against Kurdish civilians in form of arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, expulsions and enforced disappearances.
The »Hafıza Merkezi/ Truth Justice Memory
Center«, founded in Istanbul by a group of human rights
lawyers, activists and journalists, has been documenting
and publicizing these human rights violations since 2011
and is supporting victims and their families to gain just
prosecution and resolution. For decades, Kurdish families
have been taking their protest to the streets to demand
their rights, commemorate their relatives and raise
awareness. The Turkish state, however, systematically
suppresses criminal prosecution and reappraisal, which
makes the establishment of a culture of remembrance
impossible.</p>
