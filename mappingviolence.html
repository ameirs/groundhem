                  <div class="rich-text"><p><br>The Groundhem team produced the first prototype of the web platform during a two-week digital workshop in April 2020, which was originally planned as a physical event, funded by Princeton’s …., but moved online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prototype presents a timeline structured around the three phases of the transformation of Sur -- pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict -- in order to convey the continuity between the developments during these phases. Further, events on the timeline are categorized through four layers --Urban Planning, Expropriation, Conflict and Demolition -- designed to reflect the various tools of destruction and their interconnection as part of both the process of urban regeneration and urban warfare. Finally, the split-screen function allows comparison of incidents and visuals across various phases and processes of destruction as well as contrast between the developments on the ground and state narrative that contradicts them.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mapping Violence Project aims to build an open source web platform that will visualize the link between urban planning and military destruction. As such, it aims to demonstrate how the spatial practices of urban warfare—tactical incursions, mandatory curfews, and routed evacuations—functioned as tools of urban planning and real-estate development during and after the 2015 military operation in the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, Turkey. With a digital platform that will display detailed timelines of the conflict, widespread destruction, legal cases, development plans, and post-conflict reconstruction, we aim to show that the spatial features of the 2015 conflict between the Turkish military and the PKK in Sur executed displacement and transformation, enabling real estate marketization at a massive and otherwise impossible scale in the historic city center Sur. </p>
                  <p>Our platform tracks the dynamics of the conflict as they unfold in space in order to demonstrate how they conditioned a lucrative, large-scale urban development initiative by central State agencies and private contractors. We are developing tools to challenge the production of a militarized civil space-- a (post)-conflict environment made opaque to both the laws of war and civil oversight. The project will intervene in the field of (mis)information studies. Through targeted disinformation campaigns, the spatial narrative of conflict, destruction, and transformation has been deliberately distorted. Bodies, zones, responsibilities and legal regimes have been aggressively repartitioned and reclassified, blurring the line between terrorist and civilian, military installment and neighborhood, destruction and construction, evacuation and eviction, war and peace. Through open-source investigation techniques, our workflow plots and independently verifies contested events, utilizing collaborative spatial intelligence to cut through the epistemic fog of war.</p>
